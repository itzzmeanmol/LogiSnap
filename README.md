# 🪖 LogiSnap

**Smart Ordnance Store Identifier using Visual Recognition**  
A desktop application designed to assist Indian Army logistics personnel in accurately identifying ordnance store items using image recognition, QR code generation, and batch processing capabilities.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🎯 **Image-Based Item Identification**  
  Upload an image to auto-detect the Category, Cat No, Part No, and Nomenclature.

- 🧾 **QR Code Generation**  
  Automatically generates a QR containing item details for printing and tagging.

- 📂 **Batch Processing**  
  Upload an entire folder of images and predict all items in one go.

- 🖥️ **Simple and Lightweight UI**  
  Built using `Tkinter` with a clean Bootstrap theme for ease of use.

---

## 🚀 Use Case

**Problem**:  
Manual indenting often leads to incorrect entry of Cat/Part numbers or nomenclature, resulting in wrong demands and unnecessary delays.

**Solution**:  
LogiSnap provides a visual recognition tool to help store reps identify exact item details, ensuring correct and timely indent placement.
